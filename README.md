# REU_Rover_Simulator

## About
This project contains the simulator of the 2016 OSU Robotics REU multiagent coordination team.
The initial implementation will be a more basic gridworld that will be used for theoretical research.
These models will then be translated to a physical platform, the Pioneer robots.
There is the possibility for further work on more realistic simulator once the basic gridworld is complete.
